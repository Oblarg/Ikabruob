# Central limit distribution

Taking a cue from the aptly-named central limit theorem, we adopt a name for the traditional "Gaussian" distribution that refers to one of its major defining features: its appearance as a "central limit", i.e. the limit of the mean of many observations of a random variable as the number of observations increases.
