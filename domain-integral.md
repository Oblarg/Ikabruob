# Domain integral

## Traditional name(s)

 * Riemann integral

## Potential alternate name(s)

 * Vertical integral
 * Input integral

## Remarks

Can be expanded to "domain-partitioned integral" for further specificity.  The key idea here is that the Riemann integral calculates area by partitioning the domain (as opposed to the codomain/Lebesgue integral).
