# Back-adding sequence

While "back-adding" or "retroadditive" accurately describes the recursion rule that calculates the sequence, it also describes a number of similar sequences that are not the Fibonacci Sequence.  To be specific we could say "principal back-adding sequence", or even "1-1-seeded twofold back-adding sequence".
