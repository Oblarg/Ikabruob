# Back-adding sequence

## Traditional name(s)

 * Fibonacci sequence

## Potential alternate name(s)

 * Retroadditive sequence

## Remarks

While "back-adding" or "retroadditive" accurately describes the recursion rule that calculates the sequence, it also describes a number of similar sequences that are not the Fibonacci Sequence.  If we wish to be specific we can say "principal back-adding sequence", or even "1-1-seeded twofold back-adding sequence" - the nomenclature is easily adaptable.
