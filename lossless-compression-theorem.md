# Lossless compression theorem

The traditional "first Shannon theorem" establishes a bound on the possible lossless compression rate of an ergodic source along with the achievability-in-the-limit of said bound.  "Lossless compression theorem" should be unique enough to avoid confusion with other related information theoretic results.
