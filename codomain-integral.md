# Codomain integral

## Traditional name(s)

 * Lebesgue integral

## Potential alternate name(s)

 * Horizontal integral
 * Image integral
 * Output integral

## Remarks

Can be expanded to "codomain-partitioned integral" for further specificity.  The key idea here is that the codomain/Lebesgue integral calculates area by partitioning the codomain (as opposed to the domain/Riemann integral).
